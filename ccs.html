              <p>As previously mentioned, I worked at Computing and Communication Services (CCS) at the University of Guelph for 8 months co-op work term. CCS provides wide variety of IT services throughout the campus which includes internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, and support to students and staff.</p>
              <p>We have various specialized teams at CCS for various tasks such as networking, security and mail team etc. I specifically worked at the CCS Help Centre at the basement of Johnston Hall and IT Help Desk at the library in a team of 4 co-op students and various part-time students. We at the CCS Help Centre were the first line support which solved hundreds of issues of clients per day or redirected them to a specialized CCS team or non-CCS teams according to the clients’ needs.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Job Description</h2>
              <p>I worked at CCS as a Student Consultant. Being a student consultant, I was responsible to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to clients' problems. Our clients are anyone ranged from university's students to dean or faculty members. We had to maintain high professional environment since we were dealing with clients' personal information. At the CCS Help centre and IT Help Desk, we supported clients with software related issues, network connectivity, email applications, Gryph mail, malware problems, password reset and any other technical questions asked by the clients over phone, e-mails or face to face, to the best of our ability. If we were unable to solve clients' issues after extensive troubleshooting, our job was to redirect clients’ issues to our specialized CCS teams like Network Infrastructure, Security, Directory Services, Mail Team and many more.</p>

              <p>The skills needed for this job are technical knowledge, deep understanding of computers and problem solving, troubleshooting, customer service and communication skills. Along with the oral communication skills needed at IT Help Desk while giving in-person help, we needed good writing skills too to communicate with clients over e-mails. I had to work on my written communication skills which was one of my goals during this work term. I learned problem solving and troubleshooting skills from my various courses like Software Design I to Software Design III, Software System Integration and Development (also known as "Angel of Death") where I had to use problem solving skills to find the best solution for given problems. Moreover, I also learned troubleshooting skills in programming courses where output was unpredictable in the assignments.</p>

              <p>At CCS, I made my own test cases and solution documents of the problems which I was troubleshooting for team use and for future references. In addition, we got summer projects where I had to edit the CCS web pages to upgrade web documents for students and staff.</p>

              <p>Interestingly, during the summer while I was working at CCS, University of Guelph mailing system for undergraduate students migrated from Gmail to Outlook. It was a complete new thing for undergrad students. To assist students better, we learned everything about office 365 quickly. Furthermore, we made web and paper documentations for students to support them better. With the help of former CCS co-op student Joao and our supervisor Jill, migration went smoothly.</p>

              <h5>1. <u>Increase efficiency while troubleshooting problems and provide best solutions to clients' problems</u></h5>
              <p>While working at CCS, I wanted to be more efficient at troubleshooting IT problems and providing best solutions. Firstly, to troubleshoot the problem correctly, I made a checklist of questions to ask from the client since sometimes clients do not know what exactly the issue is. After understanding the problem in depth and root cause of the problem, I followed the documented procedures which have been made of specific problems. If issue would not solve after following documented procedures, I used to do my own research and I used to approach my team members to know if they have seen or solved the issue before. I used to make documents of new problems which I could solve so we could refer to something next time we see the same problem. If I along with Help Centre members were unable to solve some issues, we used to escalate those issues to specialized CCS teams.</p>
              <p>I was successful at achieving this goal as with time it took me less time to figure out what the exact problem is. As well, I could solve issues quicker than before. Moreover, the amount of escalations of issues I did to other teams decreased over time.</p> 
              <p>Many problems which we deal with at CCS like networking, security (spam) could happen in big companies too. Therefore, troubleshooting and analytical skills which I developed from this workplace will be quite useful for me in other workplaces.</p>

              <p></p>

              <h5>3. <u>Increase involvement within CCS teams</u></h5>
              <p>Teamwork skills are essential in any field. To develop teamwork skills, I increased my involvement by asking questions from team members, telling my suggestions and point of view. For any new issues, I made documented procedures and made sure I discussed all of those with my fellow co-op students. As a team, we helped each other in need and distributed tasks for CCS projects depending on people's abilities. I also approached other CCS teams to learn better solutions of various problems and to assist clients better. At the end of my co-op work term, I trained new co-op students.  </p>

              <p>I am really thankful to my team who helped me develop teamwork skills which will be beneficial to me forever in my career.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Goals</h2>
              <p>To be successful at workplace or university, we need to set some goals. Likely, I had some goals to make myself 
              successful at CCS Help Centre. My goals for my work term are:</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>2. <u>Improve time management skills and not making clients wait for long during busy times</u></h5>
              <p>Along with dealing with clients in a timely manner, my goal was to provide excellent service. When I was working at the IT Help Desk, I planned to help 2-3 people at the same time if there is a long queue to help clients efficiently. As well, I listened to everyone’s problems carefully to find the real problem and right solution to it.</p>  

              <p>I was successful at this goal as I found out with time, it took me less time to solve clients' problems and I could help 2-3 clients together efficiently. I attached some surveys on the left which are given by clients based on our performances.</p>

              <p>Time management will be useful for me in my courses as well as any future workplace because meeting deadlines is vital in software projects done in university or at a workplace.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>4. <u>Improve customer service and communication skills</u></h5>
              <p>I had some customer service experience prior to CCS from my volunteer work. My main goal was to engage customers while helping them out to develop my communication skills and to make them comfortable so they do not feel like they are working with robots. To achieve it, I engaged clients in general conversation including how their day had been so far, what are they studying etc. which made me comfortable too in taking initiative to start conversations. </p>
              <p>I was successful at achieving this goal since with time I was comfortable talking to clients and I made them comfortable too. Communication skills which I developed from this job will benefit my next work experience as communication is the key to make links and be successful in a workplace. </p>

              <p>During the time I spent at CCS, I gained a lot of technical experience. To add, I also developed critical customer service skills, analytical, communication and troubleshooting skills. I look forward to continuing working at CCS as part time. Overall, I loved this job and enjoyed every moment of my time working at CCS.</p>
