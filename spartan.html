              <p>As previously mentioned, I worked at Spartan Services Inc. for my third co-op work term of 4 months. Spartan Services Inc. is a part of the Securcor Financial Group (SFG) of companies. Spartan Services is an S&P Rated Servicer that provides portfolio tracking, reporting, auditing, compliance and portfolio servicing solutions.</p>  

              <p>To support Spartanâ€™s Audit & Compliance team, our proprietary SPARTAN (Securitization Portfolio Analysis and Review Tracking Network) software application automates the core processes and elements required for securitization on a single web enabled platform. I specifically worked with Spartan's software development team to re-engineer Spatan's financial software, their main website and to automate the processes conducted by Spartan team for auditing and tracking purposes.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Job Description</h2>
              <p>I worked at Spartan Services Inc. as a Software Developer and IT Infrastructure Support. Being a software developer at a financial compmay, I was responsible for automating as many processes as I could which were used by staff in day-to-day business work such as making reports, balance sheets, reporting to Sun Life and sending notifications of confirmation of reporting to the users on both ends. Moreover, I created a software in Perl which managed company's clients in a database and gave flexibility to the internal staff to easily add, edit or delete users. Adding users also created network folders for the new clients which was the main platform for sending and receiving files, reports etc. Furthermore, I created Securcor and Spartan's static informational websites in HTML and CSS and performed database changes/queries, SQL reports and various upgrades such as porting databases from Microsoft SQL 2003 to 2008. For their financial software, I closely communicated with the internal staff to understand the requirements and creating design for re-engineering purposes.</p> 

              <p>On the other hand, being an IT Infrastructure Support, I was responsible to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to clients' problems. Our clients were anyone working in the company such as Accountants, Financial Analysts, Auditors, CEO where their needs and IT problems were different from each other. I supported clients with software related issues, network connectivity, email applications, malware problems, password reset and any other technical questions asked by the clients. As well, I supported Spartan's IT team in their major migration of phone system.</p>

              <p>The skills needed for this job were Perl programming, Agile methodology, designing, coding, testing, technical knowledge, deep understanding of computers, problem solving, troubleshooting and communication skills. I learned development aspects of the skills (requirement gathering to deployment) from the courses I took at the university such as Software Designs, Software Engineering, Software System Integration and Development. As well, I learned technical and troubleshooting skills from the courses I took as well as from my prior co-op experience from CCS as a Student Consultant. </p>

              <p>Interestingly, during the summer while I was working at Spartan, I got to attend Rogers event at London where I visited data centre for the first time. Also, I was involved in the process of working with servers. In the end, I would say I got a chance to enhance my knowledge by exposing myslf to new technology at Spartan.</p>

              <h5>1. <u>Develop better understanding of frameworks and tools used at Spartan (Django, VMware, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio etc.) to use them efficiently at work</u></h5>

              <p>I planned to accomplish this goal by spending more time reading and researching how some of the tools used at Spartan generally work during my own time off work. Another course of action I planned to use to accomplish this goal was by following some online tutorials e.g. "Writing your first django app", backing up data through SQL Server Management tool. I also played around with various tools to learn more about them.</p>
              <p>I was successful at achieving this goal as I was able to create a small app using Django in my free time. Furthermore, I created and managed 2 servers at work as well as I successully accomplished managing and automatic replication of data using SQL Server Microsoft Studio.</p> 
              <p>I learned a lot about how data is stored, managed and replicated in databases which will be useful for me for lifetime. Database is needed at all the jobs in modern world in growing industries so I am thankful I got this opportunity which will help me at school as well as at real world jobs.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>2. <u>Learn all about Spartan services and create best solutions to the software for end users</u></h5>

              <p> I planned to use communication, empathizing and prior experience to create best solutions for clients in order to accomplish this goal. I evaluated the current software which Spartan's end users use and figured out problems they are facing, what they are happy about and what they would want to be improved. After evaluating each problem, I proposed the solution which is more efficient and reliable for the users and discussed it with my team members for second opinion.</p>

              <p>This goal was challenging since various users had different perspectives and acceptance levels but I was successful at achieving it. The best solution I chose was to talk to different users about the same problem or task and came up with a solution which was reliable for all the users. If there was any conflict, then had meeting with those clients at the same time which helped in making decision based on the best results keeping all the perspectives in mind. </p>

              <p>Empathizing with clients to get the right requirements is vital aspect of Software Development Lifecycle and developing this skill will help me in my future jobs.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Goals</h2>
              <p>To be successful at workplace or university, we need to set some goals. Likely, I had some goals to make myself 
              successful at Spartan Services Inc. My goals for my work term are:</p>    

              <img src="spartan_pics/databases.jpeg" alt="" height="390" width="525">

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>3. <u>Improve both the technical and user perspective documentation skills</u></h5>
              <p>I learned how technical documentation is written and wrote for all the programs I developed. Also, wrote non-technical documentation for end-users that was easy to understand which then would be sent to them for evaluation. I worked closely with end-users and actively communicated if they were able to understand everything or if there were any pieces which were overwhelming or missing from the documentation. </p> 

              <p>I was successful at this goal and it wasn't too challenging since I had prior experience with writing documentation from all the programming and software courses I took. The only challenge was to make a documentation which is easily understood by both technical and non-technical people. For that, I analyzed the level of understanding users had which will be reviewing the documentation and went over the previous documentations. Also, I got feedback from both technical and non-technical users which helped me improving my documentation skills.</p>

              <p>Again, documentation is one of the important aspects in software field and this experience will be useful for me for lifetime.</p>
