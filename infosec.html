              <h2 class="display-4">Job Description</h2>
              <p>I worked at CCS as an Information Security co-op. I closely worked with Information Security as well as Identity and Access team. Being an Information Security co-op, I was responsible to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Triage of Information Security tickets and incidents related to security and University account issues</li>
                <li>Working with customers via email, phone, and in person to understand and resolve problems</li>
                <li>Monitoring the information security services for anomalies and threats</li>
                <li>Monitoring information security related feeds to stay current on security updates, vulnerabilities, current attacks, and trends</li>
                <li>Assisting with the automation of tasks to enhance, streamline, and improve processes</li>
                <li>Writing, reviewing, and creating documentation for Information Security tasks and procedures</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Besides the duties mentioned above, I worked on other projects for Client Productivity team of CCS which were designed to remove some burden off their day to day responsibilities. It included tools that I developed in PHP which aid them in verifying the identity of a client before resetting their password as well as a tool to give extension to accounts, that are set up for deletion, without having to talk to an actual CCS agent. These tools save a lot of Client Productivity team’s time. Furthermore, I created automated test cases for Password Reset and Password Change tools. Automate test cases will prevent manually testing the whole application again after any changes are being done to the Password Change or Password Reset tools. </p>

              <p>In addition, I wrote two blog posts regarding cyber security topics for students and staff. Particularly, I wrote about <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/webcam-hacking">Webcam Hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/cybersafe-travel">Cyber Security while Travelling</a>. These blog posts are available at <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/webcam-hacking">https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/webcam-hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/cybersafe-travel">https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/cybersafe-travel</a>. Moreover, I learned about AODA compliance from our Accessibility team and updated all the Information Security’s documents to be AODA compliant. I also made a document teaching InfoSec team regarding how to make accessible documents. </p>

              <p>The skills needed for this job were security awareness, spam identification, programming, testing, technical knowledge, problem solving, troubleshooting, customer service and communication skills. I gained knowledge of security awareness from the Information Security course that I took at the university. Furthermore, I gained programming, testing, problem solving and troubleshooting skills from the various courses I took e.g. Software Design I to Software Design III, Software System Integration and Development etc. </p>

              <p> The interesting part of my co-op work term was the projects I worked on that I mentioned above. Also, I enjoyed writing the blog posts and reading other security blog posts which are available at <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/infosec">https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/infosec</a>. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Goals</h2>
              <p>To be successful at any workplace, it is necessary to set some goals. Likewise, I had some goals to make myself 
              successful at the Information Security. Goals for my co-op work term were:</p>

              <h5>1. <u>Develop better understanding of tools and operations used at InfoSec to use them more efficiently at work</u></h5>
              <p>This goal was directly related to the job tasks that I was supposed to perform on daily basis at the Information Security. I planned to accomplish this goal by spending more time reading SOPs and researching how some of the tools used at InfoSec generally work. When I came across any new issues on which SOPs were not available or outdated, I planned to look at the previous closed tickets to learn how and which tools were used to resolve those issues. I also sought help from my coworkers whenever I was not able to solve the issue myself.</p>
              <p>I was successful at achieving this goal as with time I got myself familiarized to Info Sec's tools and operations and gained an ability to solve issues in the best way possible. These methods include, but are not limited to, reviewing Info Sec Operations' documents, seeking help from colleagues and analyzing the problem in depth which helped me in succeeding the goal.</p> 
              <p>I developed deep understanding of cyber security tools used by Information Security at the University of Guelph. I think this knowledge will be very useful for me in future because cyber security is growing rapidly and it can help me putting my feet in this career.</p>

              <BR><BR>

              <h5>3. <u>Learn LDAP programming with PHP to finish projects that can make our other teams’ daily tasks easier while increasing security of our students and staff members’ information</u></h5>
              <p>I did not have prior experience with PHP. During my co-op work term, I learned LDAP programming with PHP. I finished two major projects that took the burden off from other CCS teams and increased security of staff and students’ personal information. To achieve this goal, I gathered the requirements by working closely with other CCS teams. I sorted requirements according to priority basis and estimated the amount of time each requirement needed to complete. Depending on the priority, I finished each task and got my tools reviewed by Identity and Access team and Client Productivity team for testing and by pen tester at Information Security to make sure my tools were vulnerability and bugs free. </p>

              <p>I developed designing and developing skills along with security analysis skills. These skills will be helpful for me regardless of which field of software I will be working at in future. </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>2. <u>Learn JMeter tool to create automate test cases on Password Change and Password Reset websites of UoG</u></h5>
              <p>I planned to accomplish this goal by spending more time reading documentation and watching tutorial videos to learn the basic functionality of this tool. Once, I got familiar with basic functionality of JMeter, I tried to perform some test cases. I was successful at this goal as I finished the automated test cases for both Password Change and Password Reset tools that can be used for testing purposes in future. As well, I gave a presentation to whole CCS team and campus wide IT people regarding JMeter and benefits of automated test cases. </p>  

              <p>From this goal, I developed software testing as well as public speaking skills that are very important in everyone’s career. </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>4. <u>Learn all about AODA compliant documentation requirements and use that knowledge to update the InfoSec documentation</u></h5>
              <p>II attended DARC MS Word workshop earlier during my work term regarding how to make MS word documents AODA compliant. After grasping all the aspects of AODA, I updated InfoSec documentation (SOPs) and created another SOP regarding how to make AODA compliant SOPs to share the knowledge with the Information Security team. </p>
              <p>I was successful at achieving this goal since I was able to convert all the documents and websites to AODA compliant. Through this experience, I now understand the needs of people with disabilities better and it opened my career opportunity to work on assessable projects.</p>

              <p>During the time I spent at Information Security, I gained a lot of experience in security vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. To add, I also developed critical analytical, communication and troubleshooting skills. I look forward to continuing working at Information Security as part time. Overall, I loved this job and enjoyed every moment of my time working at InfoSec.</p>
